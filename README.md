# ECE 220 Spring 2020

This repository contains all my coursework projects for both the normal and honors sections of Computer Systems & Programming (ECE 220), taken at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign during the Spring 2020 semester. Some of the important concepts I learned were LC3 Assembly Language Programming, C programming topics such as: Arrays, Pointers, Backtracking, DFS, Linked Lists, Trees, and how to convert C to LC3 Assembly Language. Finally, I obtained a fundamental of introductory C++ concepts and a strong understanding of multithreading.

**• Sudoku_Solver_mp7** - Array concepts and backtracking used to create an efficient Sudoku solver program.

**• 2048_Game_mp8** - Used array manipulation and pointers to code a version of the popular game 2048.

**• DFS_Maze_Solver_mp9** - Used file input/output technique and DFS to create a recursively functional Maze Solver.

**• LinkedList_Sparse_Matrix_mp10** - Used linked lists, double/single pointer logic, file input/output to work with special sparse matrices.

**• Tree_FloorPlan_mp11** - Used tree concepts and recursion to implement functionalities for a given floor-plan. 

**• Parallel_Mergesort_mp3h** - Used threading knowledge to implement both sequential and parallel versions of the mergesort algorithm.

**• Parallel_Tree_Finder_mp4h** - Used parallel threading to develop an algorithm which finds a specific element in a binary tree.

**• Serial_PThread_Intro_mp1h** - Learned how to implement simple sum accumulator using a serialized and a parallel (multi-threading) approach.

**• Serial_Parallel_Compare_mp2h** - Extension of MP1H, explored the runtime performance using serialization and parallelization and concluded which was more effective.

**• Pascal’s_Triangle_mp3** - Simple C Program which prints all Pascal’s Triangle values using user-given row index.

**• SemiPrimes_mp4** - C Program which computes all semi-prime numbers in a valid user-defined range of numbers.

**• Wheel_Of_Fortune_mp5** - Used random number generation and simple array parsing to generate modified Wheel of Fortune game.

**• Game_Of_Life_mp6** - Utilized array looping & copying concepts to create a modified version of John Conway’s Game of Life.

**• L3_Histogram_mp1** - Used LC3 Assembly Language to print out appropriate frequencies of an alphabetic histogram.

**• LC3_Stack_Calculator_mp2** - Used LC3 and basic stack operations to develop simple arithmetic calculator.

**• Intro_C++_NumberOps_mp12** - Used simple C++ class properties to develop an arithmetic calculator for real, imaginary, and complex numbers.
